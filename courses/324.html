		<td><p>Principles for designing and implementing programming languages are presented as well as styles and features that encourage and discourage the writing of good software. Topics include language syntax and semantics, comparison of language features and their implementation, methods of processing a program, establishing the run-time environment of the program and the major programming language paradigms (the imperative/procedural, functional/applicative, declarative/logic and object-oriented paradigms). Prerequisite: Computer Science 226. One unit. Offered alternate years in spring.</p></td>
